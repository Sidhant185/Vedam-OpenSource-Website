# Vedam Open Source

Static website for the Vedam Open Source Club.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step required.

## Security Notes
- No secrets should live in the frontend. Do not commit API tokens or private keys.
- `.gitignore` is configured to exclude common secret files (e.g., `.env`).
- Firebase Web API keys are public identifiers and not secrets, but restrict your Firebase security rules appropriately.

## Deploy
You can host this static site on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
